      <p>I am a freelance casting director with a passion for and experience in casting short films, music videos/ promos, online series and I also have started casting for feature films and theatre.
</p>
      <p>I also co-run my own production company Flitter Films with my other half Kristian Mitchell-Dolby where I produce and cast all of our projects so I mention Flitter Film news in my news section. 
</p>
      <p>Please get in touch if you have a project that you would like me to cast and also get in touch if you are an actor as if I find a part for you I will let you know. Also send through your headshots, showreels and any questions about acting or casting and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
</p>
      <p>On a side note to casting I am also, this year, doing a yearly fundraising event for Cancer Research UK, follow me on @CaleyPCasting here is the reason why: http://nowletmetellyou.tumblr.com  and more information will be posted up on my JustGiving page I appreciate all donations.
